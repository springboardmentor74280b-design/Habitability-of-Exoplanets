# 🪐 Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System

An AI-powered system that predicts and ranks the habitability of exoplanets using machine learning and a Flask-based web application.

The project is developed using **VS Code** and hosted on **GitHub** for version control.

---

## Project Overview

The **Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System** analyzes planetary and stellar parameters to determine whether an exoplanet can potentially support life.

It uses real-world datasets, applies machine learning techniques, and displays results through a simple and interactive web interface.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Machine learning–based habitability prediction  
- Habitability score calculation and planet ranking  
- Flask REST API backend  
- Interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Data visualization using plots and charts  
- CSV-based dataset handling
