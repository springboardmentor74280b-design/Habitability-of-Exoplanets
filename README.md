🌍 ExoHabitAI – Exoplanet Habitability Prediction
📌 Project Description

ExoHabitAI is a machine learning project that predicts whether an exoplanet is potentially habitable using its physical, orbital, and host star properties. The project helps identify planets that may support life by analyzing large astronomical datasets.

🎯 Objective

To use machine learning models to classify and rank exoplanets based on their habitability potential.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Flask (Backend API)

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

⚙️ Key Features

Exoplanet data cleaning and feature engineering

ML-based habitability prediction

Habitability score and planet ranking

Flask API for predictions

Simple and responsive user interface

Visual insights using charts and graphs

🏁 Outcome

The system predicts exoplanet habitability accurately and helps prioritize planets for further scientific research.
