# 🌍 ExoHabitAI – Exoplanet Habitability Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
ExoHabitAI is a machine learning project that predicts whether an exoplanet is potentially habitable using its physical, orbital, and host star properties. The project analyzes large astronomical datasets to identify planets that may support life.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To use machine learning models to classify and rank exoplanets based on their habitability potential.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Flask (Backend API)  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Exoplanet data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Machine learning–based habitability prediction  
- Habitability score generation and planet ranking  
- Flask API for prediction services  
- Simple and responsive user interface  
- Visual insights using charts and graphs  

---

## 🏁 Outcome
The system accurately predicts exoplanet habitability and helps prioritize planets for further scientific research.
