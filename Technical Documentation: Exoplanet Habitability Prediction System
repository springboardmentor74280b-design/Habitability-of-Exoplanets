 Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System

1. Project Overview

The **Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System** is a full-stack machine learning application designed to predict whether an exoplanet is potentially habitable based on its stellar and planetary characteristics. The system integrates data preprocessing, machine learning model training, backend APIs, and frontend visualization to deliver accurate and interpretable predictions.

This project was developed as part of an academic/industrial milestone-based learning program and demonstrates practical skills in machine learning, backend development, and system integration.

2. Objectives

* Analyze exoplanet and stellar datasets
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for habitability prediction
* Build a backend API to serve predictions
* Visualize results and model performance
* Deploy a reusable and scalable system architecture

3. System Architecture

3.1 High-Level Architecture

* **Frontend**: User interface for input and visualization
* **Backend**: REST API built using Flask/FastAPI
* **Machine Learning Model**: XGBoost-based classification model
* **Database (Optional)**: Stores exoplanet records and predictions

**Workflow**:

1. User provides exoplanet parameters
2. Backend preprocesses input data
3. ML model predicts habitability class
4. Results and confidence metrics are returned
5. Visualizations are displayed on the frontend

4. Dataset Description

* Equilibrium Temperature

4.3 Target Variable

* **Habitability Class** (Habitable / Non-Habitable)

5. Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Encoding categorical features (if any)
* Train-test split
